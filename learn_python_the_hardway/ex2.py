# https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex2.html

# Anything after the # is ignored by python.
# Multiple line comments can only be handled with a leading pound on each line

print
print "I could have code like this." # and the comment after is ignored

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
# print "This won't run."

print "This will run."

print "Hi # there." # pounds inside strings are apart of the string and not used as a comment
print
